Jungle Finance is THE liquid farming and staking solution for Solana-based assets. Jungle Finance is a Defi primitive protocol built on the Solana blockchain, allowing users to create, buy, sell and redeem their staking or farm rewards instantaneously. SPL Tokens can be deposited into Jungle auto-compounding vaults in exchange for two separate tokens; one which represents ownership of the staking or farm rewards generated over a set period of time and the other representing ownership of the base asset minus the rewards.
