Dexlab is an integrated DEX platform that provides a GUI to issue Solana-based tokens without the need to code. It leverages the Serum Decentralized Exchange (DEX)'s central order book to support ultra-fast transactions, shared liquidity, and new features for monetization. Dexlab's minting Lab will allow users to manage all aspects of a token, as well as the deployment of smart contracts that best suits their needs.
