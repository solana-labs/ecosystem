Dexlab is a decentralized exchange where users can mint and list SPL tokens. It will provide all the standard DeFi tools, as well as a GUI that facilitates the creation of SPL tokens. Our Minting Lab allows users to manage all aspects of a token, as well as the deployment of smart contracts that best suits their needs.
