We're on the verge of launching a streamlined lending platform that will give the DeFi scene on Solana a whole new level of liquidity.
We are a group of developers dedicated to developing uncensorable defi solutions and driving user migration. 

Our main goal at Twirl Finance, is to give idle Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens a distinct use case by making it possible for them to be used as leverage for borrowing. 

​By lending LP tokens rather than other assets, users can begin to accrue trade fees from the AMM while lowering the average interest rate paid.
