The Fantom Foundation is building a highly scalable blockchain ecosystem that facilitates decentralized, scalable, and secure technologies.

Fantom is a fast, scalable, and secure layer-1 platform built on an aBFT consensus protocol.

The speed, low transaction costs, and high throughput makes Fantom ideal for DeFi applications as well as real world uses.

Fantom is pushing towards a non-tribalistic cross-chain ecosystem with other platforms like Solana, while also reducing friction for developers who want to build on multiple ecosystems.
