Huobi has long been focused on innovative blockchain infrastructure and brings nearly a decade of experience to the table.

Huobi’s strategic fund will provide projects in Solana ecosystem with the strategic guidance on market insights, financing, mechanism design, and marketing support.

Up to $20M will be allocated to the teams developing the next generation of progressive and avant-garde blockchain solutions that aim to accomplish what other public chains cannot support or realize.
