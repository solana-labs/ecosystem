Badger is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on building the products and infrastructure necessary to accelerate the growth of Bitcoin in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) across multiple blockchains.

Badger Finance is a community DAO, focused on bringing Bitcoin to DeFi. The DAO's debut products are Sett, a yield aggregator, and Digg, a BTC-pegged elastic supply currency. The BADGER token is the native governance token for the DAO, granting voting rights over the future direction and use of the treasury.
