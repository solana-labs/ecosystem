SOL Survivor is a messaging app and Mortal Kombat style fighting game on the Solana testnet. The premise is simple, both users submit a hash of 4 choices: attack/block/counter/taunt. After both users have submitted their hashes, they can reveal (“unleash”) their choice. Once the first player has revealed their action, the second player will have 10 seconds to reveal their choice as well.
