StakeFi is a cross-chain staking derivatives protocol. We firmly believe that the future of DeFi is cross-chain, and are therefore exploring how we are able to help stakes in different PoS networks communicate with each other.

They are exploring an integration with Solana. Eventually with StakeFi, not only will users and investors of this protocol enjoy a fixed income from the network inflation, but they also will gain access to liquidity and yield in a cross-chain environment.
