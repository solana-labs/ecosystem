Blockchain Valley Virtual’s appeal is that it is based on an existing planned development with full rights of usage to mirror the entire physical smart city in a virtual space. This allows individuals the possibility to acquire both the physical property such as a villa or apartment, and the virtual equivalent in Blockchain Valley Virtual. This enables completely unique experiences where owners can decorate their virtual space while interacting with it in complete 1:1 accuracy with the layout of their physical property. Users can move through virtual rooms that follow the same physical boundaries as their actual property. They can decorate their virtual space with NFT-based artwork purchased in live art auctions that occur within the virtual city. They can host virtual get togethers in their home – the possibilities are continuously expanding and nearly limitless.
