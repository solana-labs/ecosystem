Banksea works to address issues in NFT collateral lending, such as a lack of reliable NFT valuation mechanisms, low utilization of NFT holders' funds,
and low security of lending funds. Banksea develops the NFT Price Discovery Protocol to evaluate a reasonable price for NFT.
Banksea aims to build an innovated, secure, and efficient NFT pool-based lending hub
