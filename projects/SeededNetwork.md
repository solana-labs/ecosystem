**What is Seeded Network?**

Seeded network is an upcoming incubator on Solana offering unique borrowing, lending, and staking solutions to users allowing them to safely participate in the seeded incubation projects.
Seeded aims to provide equal and fair opportunity to investors who actively want to take part in the pre-sale rounds by making sure even the average user can afford to do so. 
Projects will go through rigorous background checks from the team and community before being part of the seeded incubation process to maximise the user safety.
Seeded aims to incubate blue chip projects which have a similar goal of changing the defi landscape by offering something unique to the industry and having real world applications.
