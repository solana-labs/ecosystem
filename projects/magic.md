Magic has developed an SDK that allows users to access decentralised applications with a phone number or email address, all without the need for a browser extension, allowing developers to capture a market of users previously unfamiliar with existing wallet providers. Itâ€™s as simple as adding 3 code snippets to any existing web3 applications. Magic is integrated in over 20 applications, including Set Protocol and Uniswap.
