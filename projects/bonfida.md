Bonfida is a full product suite that bridges the gap between Serum, Solana, and the user. It aims to be a single source of data truth in the cryptocurrency industry, focusing on, among other things, exchange statistics, crypto company reviewing and scoring, and researching crypto trends.

Bonfida also handles an array of data aggregation and visualisation, which has proved popular among crypto traders who don’t typically have the means to parse this data themselves.
