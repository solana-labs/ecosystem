# Lore

Long ago, girls from across the world started manifesting mystical powers. They received mythical gifts from the Mystic Goddess. Some underwent physical changes granting them unique features. At the same time, some gained strange, powerful abilities.

The folks praised and worshiped some of them, while most were shunned and exiled. Alone, they felt. One by one, these girls found one another, and they formed a community, a club. They found solace in each other.

The Mystic Girls Club, they called themselves. Now, the Mystic Girls want to help other communities who have felt marginalized or overlooked by society so that no one would feel as helpless as they once did.
