Utilizing innovations of web3, Nina provides the infrastructure for artists to control distribution, publication, and revenue streams for their work in a way never before possible.

In the legacy music industry, the infrastructure providers profit by taking a piece of the artistâ€™s revenue. This is no longer necessary. Decentralized file-distribution, tokenized ownership, and transparent royalty payments circumvent the exploitative status-quo of the music industry.

Artists, fans, and protocol stakeholders alike can have a direct say in the evolution of the future of music online via decentralized governance.

At Nina we believe a protocol that provides maximum value to artists and fans alike will bring the next wave of users to web3.
