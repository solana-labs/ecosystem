Utilizing innovations of web3, Nina provides the infrastructure for
artists to control distribution, publication, and revenue streams for
their work in a way never before possible.

In the legacy music industry, the infrastructure providers profit by
taking a piece of the artist’s revenue. This is no longer necessary.
Decentralized file-distribution, tokenized ownership, and transparent
royalty payments circumvent the exploitative status-quo of the music
industry.

Artists, fans, and protocol stakeholders alike can have a direct say in
the evolution of the future of music online via decentralized
governance.

At Nina we believe a protocol that provides maximum value to artists
and fans alike will bring the next wave of users to web3.
