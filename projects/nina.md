Utilizing innovations of web3, Nina provides the infrastructure for
artists to control distribution, publication, and revenue streams for
their work in a revolutionary way.

Decentralized file-distribution, tokenized ownership, and transparent
royalty payments circumvent the exploitative status-quo of the music
industry.

Currently, nfrastructure providers in the industry profit by
taking a piece of the artistâ€™s revenue. Nina deems this unnecessary.

At Nina, we believe a protocol that provides maximum value to artists
and fans alike will bring the next wave of users to web3.

Artists, fans, and protocol stakeholders alike will now have a direct say in
the evolution of the future of music online via decentralized
governance.
