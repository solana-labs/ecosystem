Steaking makes staking easy and secure. Staking is the easiest way to earn passive income by letting your cryptocurrency work for you. Staking is when users lock their funds to participate in maintaining the integrity of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains. These users are then rewarded through block rewards and transaction fees.
Staking Solana is a safe and passive way to earn more Solana. By staking, you are keeping the network secure, decentralized, and earning rewards for it. For example, you can stake 100 Solana and in return, you can expect to have up to 7% more Solana every year from staking rewards.
