Aliens VS People is the first entirely on-chain, multiplayer NFT video game on the Solana blockchain. It is a Battleship-style intergalactic war game where teams of aliens and humans compete to destroy each other first. As the game is ready, it will be immediately playable as soon as the alien and human NFTs are minted. 

A demo of the functional proof-of-concept game can be viewed here: https://aliensvspeople.com/docs/Demo.mp4
