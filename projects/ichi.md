ICHI is building a Decentralized Monetary Authority for the Solana community. This will bring the first decentralized stablecoin to the Solana ecosystem. oneSOL will be capital efficient (does not require you take a debt position), decentralized (governed by its holders), growth enabling (putting upward price pressure on the underlying SOL), and 100% on-chain (fully transparent). This will enable Solana to implement its own Monetary Policy through an underlying stable asset.
