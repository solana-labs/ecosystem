APYSwap is a protocol for the decentralized exchange of shares of Tokenized Vaults. Through the creation of a Layer 2 blockchain, users can trustlessly swap accounts and assets from multiple Layer 1 blockchains including Ethereum, Polkadot, and Binance Smart Chain. APYSwap simplifies yield farming and reduces its costs for users, without sacrificing decentralization or self-custody. By allowing trustless trading of tokenized yields, greater liquidity and other benefits are ensured. With APYSwap, cryptocurrency holders can benefit from passive income without the demands of active portfolio management, while active DeFi portfolio managers trustlessly trade on behalf of users and generate profits without friction or high transaction fees.
