APYSwap is a protocol for the decentralised exchange of shares of Tokenized Vaults. It achieves this through the creation of a Layer 2 blockchain where users can trustlessly swap accounts & assets from multiple Layer 1 blockchains including Ethereum, Polkadot and Binance Smart Chain.
APYSwap simplifies yield farming and reduces its costs for users, without sacrificing decentralisation or self-custody. By allowing the trustless trading of tokenized yields, it also introduces greater liquidity and other novel attractive properties.
With APYSwap, cryptocurrency holders can benefit from passive income without the demands of active portfolio management, whilst active DeFi portfolio managers can trustlessly trade on behalf of users and generate profits without friction or high transaction fees.
