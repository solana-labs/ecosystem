Star Atlas is proud to announce that it has selected Solana as the protocol to build out its blockchain driven massively-multi player metaverse. Star Atlas is developing a unique gaming experience by combining blockchain mechanics with traditional game mechanics. Solana launched the first ever “web-scale blockchain” in 2019 making it the only blockchain solution capable of hosting applications with the computational bandwidth akin to the modern internet, presenting the capability to power decentralized versions of Nasdaq, Facebook, Twitter and all other existing blockchains. Star Atlas fully embraces the potential of decentralized self-sovereign ownership of assets permitted through the implementation of blockchain into asset ownership and NFT marketplaces.

> “Star Atlas will provide the most powerful opportunity in human history for players to realize economic benefits through the extraction of in-game virtual earnings into real-world income. This integration optimizes Star Atlas’ long term goals by plugging into Solana’s thriving community, ecosystem, and best in class technology. The overall vision for Star Atlas is not possible on any other blockchain.” Michael Wagner, CFA - Star Atlas, CEO.
