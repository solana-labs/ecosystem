BRZ, the largest stablecoin in Latin America, manages a $20m regional fund. The instrument is targeting Brazilian and LATAM startups and projects building impactful solutions on top of Solana's ecosystem. The investment thesis will take into account the potential for real-world use cases, with a focus on financial applications that can bring innovation to developing economies in Latin America. Initiatives that aim to integrate LATAM with the global financial system are welcome, preferably to the areas of lending, trade finance, and payments. The fund will also consider projects based outside of the continent, as long as the team shows clear connection to Brazil. Solutions that enable further use of the BRZ stablecoin are a plus.
