Empowered by premier artists from the film and gaming industries, Joylina’s Cantina is connecting art to open source game development through trading card NFTs. All cards wield unique, randomly generated stats, classes, power ups, and scarcity. Each of the 10,000 one-of-a-kind cards will be minted as an NFT on the Solana blockchain. At its heart, Joylina’s Cantina is a creative art project with a mission to elevate artists and build a community-driven universe full of extraordinary characters. We envision a future in which our trading cards are used to build new worlds.
