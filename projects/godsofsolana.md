 Idea behind our project is that each person gets the chance to receive that “Top God” status. When we are born each of us get something that our ancestors left us with and each one of us gets labeled by work that they did, that process reflects minting in our case where you get that status not by your will, but by the will of others. After that you choose your own path, either you continue with what your ancestors left you with, never expanding and never evolving or you continue to fight and improve(in our case buying higher rarity NFTs from others).
 
That’s the time where “Clash of Gods” take place where you can prove yourself in many different events(for example art competitions, gaming events, programming, singing etc. everything will be voted by our community) and can earn SOL from our treasury so you can get more exposure and can buy higher value NFT from others moving your status forward.
In our lives not everyone can achieve “Top God” status, only a few hard working, lucky, talented can achieve that state. In that process we all go through process of choosing our path, either we choose Angel path or Devil path.
