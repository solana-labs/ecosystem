**SoAliens**

AlienVille is a small city in the United States of America. In case you wonder – yes, only soAliens live here and let us tell how this came along.

After several mysteries about Aliens and Area 51, the ones who knew, revealed that soAliens have been living amongst us for quite a while and have adapted to 
our lifestyle – they speak English, have jobs, go to school, hangout and are even involved in arts and crafts. The soAliens reproduced over time and have become
a society like ours – they just look a bit different. A collection of 10.000 of soAliens NFTs represents this unique society of soAliens.

The soAliens NFTs come with a few unique features.

-          Deflationary Mechanism

-          Scavenger Hunt

-          Exclusive Music Access
