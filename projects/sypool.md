Sypool Protocol is a synthetic asset management protocol. This is another innovation that we have migrated finance from off-chain to on-chain.

This idea was inspired by off-chain fund companies and packaged asset derivatives. On the one hand, we tokenize fund shares. On the other hand, this share token actually represents a small part of a multi-token pool, thus providing the scarce liquidity for the cryptocurrency market.
