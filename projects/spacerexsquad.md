**THE STORY
OF THE SPACE REX SQUAD**

The Space Rex Squad is a collection of 8888 completely unique art pieces, living on the Solana Blockchain.
What if 66 million years ago, the dinosaurs would not have been erased from the earth's surface? What if they survived asteroids, 
ice ages and massive volcanic eruptions? Well, they would have obviously evolved into reptilian humanoids, conquering the world, and it's nature. 
But as these dinosaurs survived the first wave of natural disasters, the next wave does not take long to come and this time, the dinosaurs won't survive just by luck. 
Overpopulation, climate change and scarcity of resources leaves the dinosaurs with no choice but to search for new places to live in space. Various groups of dinosaurs 
have been sent on space missions to ensure their continued existence. The most promising and dangerous group of them: The Space Rex Squad, makes the beginning and goes 
to previously unexplored areas of the Milky Way with their mission to ensure the survival of their species.
