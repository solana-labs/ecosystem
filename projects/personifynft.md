The Personify Team is here to bring you 8,888 unique pieces of art. These art pieces are used to describe events, emotions, people, etc. Our goal is to create art pieces that are beautiful to look at. We are not here to create template art for flippers. Our team of artists, innovators, and developers hope to create work based on the voice of our community. Being the first and only limited NFT drop to provide truly unique images, we are committed to giving each and every art piece value. The rarity of the art will be set solely on the owner's taste and preferences, 
just like how real art should be. We hope you'll support us on this journey and become a part of Personify.
