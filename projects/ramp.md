RAMP DeFI is committed to releasing liquidity from mortgaged digital assets. Our solution enables SOL users to obtain additional liquidity without giving up their mortgage rewards or capital appreciation potential.

Through the RAMP smart contract, users can mortgage SOL to obtain the local stable currency solUSD on the Solana network, and then exchange the solUSD into the stable currency rUSD with the equivalent value of 1:1 on the Ethereum network.

Users who hold rUSD can borrow or exchange stable currencies equivalent to legal currencies, such as USDT or USDC. These stable currencies can be used to invest in new DeFi projects, transactions, or exchange into legal currencies.
