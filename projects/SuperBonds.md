The SuperBonds platform employs financial NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) to facilitate DeFi’s first bond market. 
Traders can buy fixed yield bonds as financial NFTs that are redeemable anytime. These bonds can be self-custodied. 
LPs (Liquidity Providers), who will underwrite the bonds, will have access to multiple revenue streams via the SuperBond 
platform to incentivise bond creation.
