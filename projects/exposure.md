Exposure is developing the first automated crypto traded fund (ACTF) that is available on a decentralized application (dApp) built using Solana, a smart contract blockchain. Exposure's goal is to create decentralized investment products that can increase exposure to cryptocurrency markets, while at the same time decreasing portfolio risk.

Exposure is being developed by Anaxii Blockchain Group. A collective of developers looking to bridge that gap between traditional finance and blockchain.
