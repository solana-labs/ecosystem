Your Dancing Deer NFT avatar is your key into the Dancing Deer Disco. There are 2222 unique Deer avatars that have been randomly generated on the Solana blockchain for you to collect. 
Some Deer are rarer than others. Deer can have up to 11 traits out of a possible 200+.

Once you buy your Deer, you own all IP and possess all commercial rights for the image and artwork as long as you hold the Deer in your wallet. Rights are transferred to the new owner anytime a Deer is sold on secondary. 
There is a 5% royalty for all secondary transactions that will be used to fund the new Deer NFT collection.
