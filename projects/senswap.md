SenSwap: An open liquidity protocol for token swap on Solana designed to remove technical barriers to bring AMM to more regular users. In SenSwap, the pool is no longer organized into two tokens. Now a trilogy pool, the protocol will automatically balance the deposit in the case of single-sided deposits (Simulated Single Exposure-SSE), and the native token, SEN, will be the heart of the protocol and connects all pools (Simulated Mesh Exchange-SME).
In addition, SenSwap shares the common cash-flow interface based on SEN that allows services to easily capture the profit and feed it to other services.
Moreover, SenSwap encourages community contribution by serving a well-designed toolchain and provides groundwork for DeFiâ€™s sustainable development.
