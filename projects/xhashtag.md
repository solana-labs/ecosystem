Building on Solana, xHashtag is a Play2Earn DAO for Future Of Work where users can earn crypto by completing simple on-chain or off-chain tasks.

Projects can leverage community talent to accelerate community growth by rewarding valuable actions in their own $tokens with optional vesting to balance sell pressure. From a user’s perspective, xHashtag offers a way to earn rewards for completing tasks, while for the project, it presents a way to effectively achieve a wide token distribution with high ROI by building a community that constantly propels project’s on-chain and off-chain activities.
