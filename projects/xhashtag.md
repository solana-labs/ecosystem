xHashtag enables fractional ownership of tokenized #hashtags purchasable by locking $XTAG tokens into a bonding curve contract that controls price in relation to supply of #hashtags and guarantees liquidity. The protocol burns #hashtags based on its performance on twitter, increasing its floor price over time. xHashtag is also a powerful twitter marketing tool for crypto projects to drive consistent conversation and gain traction on the CryptoTwitter while incentivizing their fans.
