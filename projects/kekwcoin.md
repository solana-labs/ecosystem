KEKW is a space allowing creators to engage, collaborate, and fulfill personal initiatives. This space is designed to bring opportunities to new creators, giving them a window to expose their talent and, as a community driven ecosystem, the opportunity to be valued and rewarded for their contributions.

Voting, organizing different collectives, and funding new collaborative efforts will be some of the opportunities KEKW community members will gain.

This will be of benefit to both the benefactor and the creator himself, as the donor helps enable the creator and provides growth, in turn capitalizing on their investment as the creatorâ€™s project
gets more exposure.

$KEKW coin will serve as a direct mechanism to provide economic support to creators and community members alike by assigning them a direct monetary allocation to be paid in $KEKW. It
will also help them exchange services and digital content to be traded directly on our platforms. This
digital currency can be distributed as a reward for contest winners or other miscellaneous events. Lastly, $KEKW will act as a governance tool, ensuring the decisions made for the community are also backed in a fair, transparent manner.

Solana's ecosystem provides a basis for our framework, ensuring the space will support a high volume of creators. More information can be found in our Litepaper: https://www.kekw.io/assets/kekwcoin_litepaper_v1.pdf
