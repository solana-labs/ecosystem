COPE is a two-phased project: Phase 1 of COPE seeks to analyze trader weaknesses retrospectively based on trader calls made about crypto markets. Top Call Makers are evaluated based on their call accuracy which, along with other parameters, results in a COPE score. The top 100 Call Makers are ranked by their COPE score and indexed. Once a consistent list of the top 100 has been generated after the monthly 'reformation', the introduction of new Top Call Makers into the index provides a framework for refreshed investment strategies based on accurately measured trader calls, which leads to phase 2.
