Lido lets users stake their assets for daily staking rewards. User can stake any amount of tokens with no minimum limit. When staking Lido, you mint staked tokens which are pegged 1:1 to your initial stake. Your staked tokens can be used across the DeFi ecosystem to compound your yield. Lido lets you use your staked assets to gain yield on top of yield. Use your tokens (which earn daily staking rewards) as collateral, for lending, yield farming and more.
