Coin98 Ventures — the investment arm of Coin98 Finance, a blockchain-focused software company in Vietnam — announced an ecosystem fund of up to $5 million in partnership with the Solana Foundation. The new fund was established in December 2020 to nurture the Solana developer ecosystem in Southeast Asia, with a particular focus on Vietnam. The fund will be deployed over the next three years, concluding in January 2024.

Apart from financing, projects are provided with Coin98 ecosystem’s resources accumulated over the years, industry connections, strategic advisory, and other extensive support to build meaningful products.
