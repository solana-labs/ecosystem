The P2P Org team built a bundle of open-source Solana wallet implementations, written for iOS, Android, and a web browser version. The team leveraged Solana, Serum, and Bonfida infrastructure. P2P Wallet offers super-speed and free transactions. It is the first ever wallet where you can send money with free transactions and without hidden fees.
