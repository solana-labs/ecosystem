Big Data Protocol has the following products:

1. Data Vault and Data Room have built tech to tokenize datasets, make data tokens liquid, and redeem the data tokens for the underlying datasets.

2. Weâ€™re also working with the Ocean Protocol team to fork Ocean Market. BDP will have full Ocean Market capabilities.
