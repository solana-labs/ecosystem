Human Protocol helps machines learn by soliciting real people to perform "labeling tasks"â€”identifying raw data, such as videos, images, and text. That, in turn, provides meaningful information for machine learning to improve tasks such as visual or vocal recognition.

The Singapore-based company is integrating with Solana as scalability is crucial to equipping developers and organizations with additional resources to execute task labeling.
