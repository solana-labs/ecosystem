AstraPad is a solana-based launchpad platform with a few defining characteristics.
We pair a launchpad with a decentralized incubator. Purely "allocation" based launchpads feel unreachable to a lot of crypto investors, as to get a decent allocation of tokens from a promising IDO project may cost a literal fortune. We feel like we can make it a little more fair for everybody. We put a lot of emphasis into Community Governance, giving our investors a chance to vote on the projects and other major or minor decisions. The AstraPad incubator makes it a lot more accessible for everyone to play a part in the process and get their share of IDO tokens without active involvement or a huge sum of money. AstraPad also provides an additional stream of revenue through the staking pools, where you stake your tokens and get rewarded with more AstraPad tokens.
