This started as a fun educational project to learn the pieces of the NFT puzzle and quickly morphed into 9700 unique digital collectibles ready to mint. At first, 
this was going to be a set of cutesy looking crocodiles that can camouflage into different environments, blend into society by taking on the traits from different cultures. Then our awesome artist hundredboys joined the team.

When we looked at his concept art, we realized it would be a sin to not bring this to life and let our NFT community share the experience. So our cutesy crocs turned into gritty, badass crocs with extreme visual details, 
while keeping their camouflaging abilities intact. We're thrilled to share the making of awesome with you.
