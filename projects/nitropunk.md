Inspired by classic arcade racing games like OutRun and Cruis'n USA, Nitropunk cars are a collection of 10,000 unique, collectable, and soon raceable NFTs on the Solana blockchain!
Each animated pixel car is randomly crafted from multiple properties like car bodies, paint jobs, wraps, wheels, spoilers, body kits, and more with over 1 billion combinations.
