The Time Keepers is an exclusive collection of 7,200 NFTs on the Solana blockchain where holders can own an hour and minute of the day.

Holders will benefit from the collaboration laboratory, the property exchange marketplace, the Time Keeper token airdrop, community fund management, and the distribution of 
secondary sale royalties.

The Time Keepers will be a timeless collection to provide long-term value to all owners. 1,000 are available in the presale, with the remaining 6,200 being sold in the public sale.
