Crooks are all about family. Choose to join one of 4 different Crook families. You'll compete against other Crook families in a series of recurring minigames for turf and loot. 
The winning family each week wins 30% of trading royalties from a community wallet. Crooks are tightknit group, but you can forge even closer bonds with your family members.
