Block Asset is a verified NFT ecosystem connecting fans to athletes. We leverage strategic relationships with athletes, agencies, and clubs and connect them to fans using our proprietary NFT marketplace, blockchain NFT ticketing, and blockchain NFT gaming.

Block Asset is building upon the Metaplex protocol to bring elite athletes into the ecosystem. By working directly with sports stars around the globe, we offer unrivaled real-life experiences and rewards, which are attached to collectible pieces officially verified by the athlete themselves. We will be releasing a token in the near future which will have staking, liquidity, and incentives. Further details to come.
