As humanity’s destruction of nature spread, we were forced to adapt. We grew arms, learned our way around every kind of weapon and gathered on the Solana blockchain to form an army of 5000 Furious Flowers.
Our Flowers are randomly generated using over 190+ different attributes with varying rarities. The traits include face, stem, petals, hands, teeth, backround, face color and petal color. A list with all attributes and their respective rarities will be available here shortly after the launch.
All our flowers are 3D rendered in Blender, using Cycles. Cycles is a ray-trace based render engine, creating realistic lighting, shadows and reflections. With an emphasis on imperfections, realistic materials and gruesome weapons, we aim to create a sinister take on the classic claymation style.
