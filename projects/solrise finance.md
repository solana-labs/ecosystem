Solrise is a fully decentralized and non-custodial protocol for investment funds on Solana. What this means in practice is that anyone can open a fund, and anyone can invest in it. Solrise is easy to use, practical, and almost trustless.
We have built a decentralized fund management and investment protocol on Solana. On-chain asset swapping, price discovery and oracles made this a pretty natural idea to implement. Our platform allows fund managers from all across the globe - whether they be well-established and looking for a new channel, or ambitious rookies with something to prove - to open a fund, with performance kept completely transparent.
