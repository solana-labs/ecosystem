Aviata is an open-source Decentralized Automated Flight Cancellation Insurance protocol. The protocol takes advantage of the current main benefits of decentralized infrastructure to offer an Automated Plane Ticket Cancellation Insurance in a trustless manner that is also cheaper and faster without the need of a central party responsible for reviewing user information, insurance claims or issuing refunds.
