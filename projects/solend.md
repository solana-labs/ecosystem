Solend is an algorithmic, decentralized protocol for lending and borrowing on Solana. Think Aave or Compound on Solana. Solend allows anyone with an internet connection to earn interest by lending their assets, and allows them to use their deposits as collateral for borrowing. Solend supports cross-collateral lending, ctokens, flash loans, and more. Solend is composable with other Solana DeFi dapps, which makes for a vibrant DeFi ecosystem. Solend already supports many Solana ecosystem tokens and is continually adding more.

Aave, Compound, and other DeFi dapps are expensive and slow due to being built on Ethereum. Solend is 100x cheaper and faster thanks to Solana's scaling innovations.

Solend is the easiest-to-use and most secure borrowing and lending protocol on Solana, and is quickly becoming a core DeFi primitive of the Solana ecosystem.
