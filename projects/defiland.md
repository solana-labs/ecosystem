DeFi Land is a multi-chain agriculture simulation web-game created to gamify decentralized finance. It will have all the features that traditional platforms have, but it will be gathered all in one place. DeFi Land will be running on top of established platforms, meaning users will be using well-known AMMs/DEXs/lending protocols through our game. For example, when a player tries yield farming in our game they will actually be using different pools and staking platforms through our interface.
