FABRIC is built on the Solana Ecosystem that leverages the Serum DEX GUI to allow users to trade FAB.
The FABRIC protocol is a decentralized synthetic asset issuance protocol built on Solana. All synthetic assets are collateralized by FABRIC tokens (FAB) which must be locked in the FABRIC pool to enable issuance of synthetic assets, known as SPL Synthetics. Users directly interact with the FABRIC pool, requiring no counterparties and avoiding common issues experienced on exchanges such as liquidity or slippage issues. Once minted, users can trade these SPL Synthetics on the Serum DEX. It is not required to hold FAB to trade on the Fsynth.Exchange or Serum DEX.
