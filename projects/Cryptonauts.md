The mutated Cryponauts Academy cadets have traveled across the Metaverse looking for a new home after a solar flare destroyed their spacecraft. Minting soon!

TIEXO is a cross chain NFT marketplace and free generative design tool that is empowering Creators to launch their first NFT collection.

The Marketplace, Artists Toolbox and TIEXO Academy form the first all-in-one platform that makes NFTs accessible to first time newcomers while also being a sophisticated blockchain tool for experienced veterans.
