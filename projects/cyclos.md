Cyclos is the first concentrated liquidity AMM on Solana. It enables
higher yields for LPs and better rates for traders by merging
concentrated liquidity with Project Serum's central limit order book.
On Cyclos, concentrated liquidity allows users to choose a price
range within which they are willing to make markets, reaping LP
rewards with only a fraction of the previously required capital.
