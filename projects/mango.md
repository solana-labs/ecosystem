Mango is a decentralized, cross-margin trading platform with up to 5x leverage and integrated limit orders on Serum DEX’s on-chain order book. Makers or takers can earn interest on deposits and margin positions, as well as trade with near zero fees thanks to Solana’s high-performance blockchain. Additionally, users can contribute SRM into a shared pool to reduce the fees for all traders on the platform. Congrats Team Mango!
