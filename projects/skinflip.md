SkinFlip is an easy-to-use, hybrid NFT marketplace and wallet platform for video game assets, integrated with the Solana blockchain. The platform is powered by SkinFlip Turtles NFT collection and by the SkinFlip Exchange Token (SFX), where both provide DeFi and marketplace utility to its holders.

Our vision is to build a multichain platform here gamers can securely trade video game assets, discover exciting video game titles and expand their knowledge about NFT technology. We are strong advocates of open game economics and will rigorously push for NFTs to become the standard of the gaming industry.
