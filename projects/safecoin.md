SafeCoin is a lightning fast and efficient Proof-of-Stake blockchain
network based on the Solana code base. Thanks to Solana’s unique
multithreaded architecture and Proof of History protocol, the SafeCoin
network can process an incredible 65,000+ transactions per second.

With the power of multi-threading, the SafeCoin network is the world's
most energy efficient crypto using \~0.0000027kW per transaction.

Solana’s best features are adopted while improving upon the code to make
it more accessible to a greater number of people.

The main difference between Solana and SafeCoin is that nearly anyone
can run their own validator and participate in the network.

Furthermore, SafeCoin did not have an ICO, IEO or any initial sales
offerings.
