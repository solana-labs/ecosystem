GraphLinq currently has integrations for ethereum, BSC & Polygon and is now building the following integrations:

1. Integration on our IDE & Engine
   Logical Solana blocks/connectors for the following:
   -> Solana Connector
   -> On Solana Block
   -> On Solana Transaction
   -> On Solana Wallet Transaction
   -> Get SOL Balance

These blocks would be able to connect to any of the other 200+ logical blocks available on our iDE. For eg. An on-chain stop loss on Pancakeswap, and many other use cases are possible.

Sample: Search for "Ethereum" on our IDE and browse all the available blocks.

2. Integration on our App:
   We'll have pre-made templates for Solana on our app, so newcomers/newbies can just come in, choose a template, change values here and there, and simply deploy!

3. Integration on our Analytics:
   We'll show Solana chain's data visually onto our Analytics platform. All of the data we'll fetch from our Engine/IDE, so we'll be open to adding more connectors depending on what you would like to present onto our analytics.

Sample: https://analytics.graphlinq.io/analytics/unicrypt
We've also partnered up with Polygon (Previously Matic), and will set up analytics for them next.

Please let us know if you are interested in making things official and partner with us. We're really looking forward to working with the great minds at Solana.
