Each NFT consists of a circular spectrogram, computed from a unique animal sound. The spectrogram breaks down the sound into its base frequencies, providing a Soundprint which reveals the hidden mathematical beauty of the animals's call.
We will mobilise the NFT community in support of wildlife conservation by 1. donating $200,000 from our proceeds to partnered charities and 2. splitting royalties from the secondary market 50% to charity and 50% to the artists.
