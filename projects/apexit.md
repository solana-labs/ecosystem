apeXit is a Solana on-chain risk management tool that enables the end-user to instantly close spot holdings over the Solana ecosystem in a tap.

The platform aggregates all DEXes, LPs and tokens that a user may have associated with their non-custodial wallets and immediately allows them to get out of all their po- sitions on a single operation.

On current crypto volatile markets, apeXit aims to be the fastest and most convenient solution for the user to swap all Solana-based tokens to USDC, a stable usd-pegged cryptocurrency.
