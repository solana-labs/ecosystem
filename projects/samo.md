Even though it was originally released as a memecoin, SAMO is becoming a real Solana ambassador. Helping introduce Solana to new people, building new and exciting solutions for the ecosystem, the cutest dog can do it all. Enhancing the user experience for everyone using the Solana ecosystem and also helping other projects along the way.
Not only is it the most adorable dog on any blockchain, it also bears the name of one of Solana’s ecosystem most prominent figures: Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX, making it the perfect Solana doge! It’s community-owned and fun!
