QuickNode's mission is to help blockchain ecosystems scale, by providing accessible core infrastructure. QuickNode makes it simple to power blockchain applications and scale up as you grow. From elastic APIs & dedicated nodes, to powerful tools & analytics, all at your command through a simple control panel.
With QuickNode, you either have a dedicated endpoint which is always serving traffic from the same location as designated when you booted the endpoint or you get access to our global network which always routes to the nearest available endpoint.
