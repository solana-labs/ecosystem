SolBunny combine its engaging community with strong fundamentals in DeFi. 
The principles of liquid democracy (delegative democracy) are implemented to bridge DeFi into real world utility.

Members directly vote or delegate their vote to others within STEM or humanities.
The former focus on quantitative drivers of finance while the latter improve the community qualities.

The sequential execution takes place in a metaverse, BunnyVerse, on the Solana blockchain. 
It offers DeFi in microcredits to venture capital funds, both on-chain and in real world projects.
