Audius is the latest project to move over to Solana and has been growing rapidly, now with over 1 million monthly listeners. However, as their active users have increased, so have the gas fees and load times. Audius is creating a fully decentralized community of artists, developers, and listeners collaborating to share and defend the world's music.

Using Audius, creators can generate immutable and time-stamped records for creative works and register assets to the Audius network, because the network is decentralized and secured by blockchain.

Solana was selected after the Audius team reviewed and tested over 20 layer 1 and layer 2 scaling solutions. Through that vetting process, it was clear that Solana was the only system that could deliver the speed, low fees, and censorship resistance necessary to grow Audius to a mainstream, global audience.
