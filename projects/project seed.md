Project SEED is one of the first gaming platforms built on the Solana blockchain. Project SEED ecosystem includes a Game Studio, DEX, NFT marketplace, and a wallet. Project SEED aims to bring one of the world's first blockchain gaming to players in mobile phones and devices. 
 
Project SEED will launch in an integrated Game App, where players can interact with their beasts, which are called Zeds, and explore the world alone or in a team to revive the land. Players can battle against each other in tournaments, join co-op adventures to gain experiences, tame Zeds, join guilds, build dungeons, and many more. Besides the game, a DEX, NFT marketplace, and also crypto wallet will also be integrated inside the game. The details will be explained further in this whitepaper.

Project SEED App requires affordable gas fees, fast TPS, and also robust blockchain networks, this is why we choose to build on Solana. Even though players will need to spend gas for interacting with the blockchain, Project SEED aims to be the best Play-to-Earn game, instead of a Pay-to-Win system. In the ecosystem, players can earn SHILL tokens for completing certain tasks/quests created by the GMs or other players in the ecosystem, or by leveling up and gathering enough materials to unlock a new variety of weapons or equipment, or by evolving their Zeds and selling them as NFT. 

SHILL token will be the utility token used in the ecosystem, whether for trading, staking, or voting (DAO). It will be presented as a multi-chain currency, where we will do mint-and-burn to equalize the circulation and total supply of our token. 
 
Finally, as gaming is a universal activity loved by millions of people, Project SEED will bring the Blockchain Gaming ecosystem for mass adoption. Our game will be ready for blockchain-savvy gamers as well as non-blockchain gamers. This game will be the first blockchain game Project SEED launch, and more games will be developed in this platform in the long-term horizon.
