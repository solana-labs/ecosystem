Scallop is a Defi game on Solana. Users can stake their SOL here to grow a scallop and have chances to win tokens and NFTs. At the end of each week, one (or a few) winners will be chosen by the program randomly to share out some of the stake. 7% of SOL reward will be kept in the staking pool, 93% will be SCA buyback. During the game users can win Scallop Decorations by carrying out some tasks✨!
