Established in January of 2021, Gate Labs was founded to provide entrepreneurs within the blockchain sector the support they need to grow their business.

Up to $20M will be deployed through the Gate.io’s fund across projects building on Solana.

These projects are granted access to growth opportunities within new markets in the Asia-Pacific region. As the investment arm of the Gate.io exchange, Gate Labs will help projects gain exposure to global audiences and support long-term formulation of brand awareness.
