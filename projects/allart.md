The All-Art protocol provides constant liquidity for NFTs by introducing a new type of liquidity pool AMM while upgrading the current NFT standard with improved functionalities and embedded license rights called NFT-PRO. The All-Art Protocol will enable NFTs to become perpetually traded like any crypto token with continuous liquidity through a new type of AMM liquidity pool.

The All-Art Protocol runs on a new superior blockchain - Solana, with four key benefits:

1. Blazing speed and cheap transactions running on L1
2. Scalability
3. Low energy consumption
4. Upgradable smart contracts
