Satellite.im is a multi-platform messaging app built on Solana and IPFS. Satellite is built using serverless technology with peer to peer workflows. Everything is encrypted so your data only gets read by who you intend it to. Satellite is also built to be offline-first. Satellite gives you peace of mind with end-to-end encryption without sacrificing quality. You can stream in 4k, chat in 500kbs+, and share 10GB files.
