Velas announced their support for the Solana codebase, resulting in one of the fastest blockchain frameworks in the industry. Velas has now added support for Ethereum Virtual Machine.

Velas will expand upon the Solana codebase in order to obtain and leverage one of the fastest blockchain frameworks in the entire crypto industry, far exceeding previous framework speeds and those of competitors, while furthering the visions and aspirations of the Velas journey further.

Ethereum Virtual Machine will be supported on Velas as a development by the Velas team on top of the Solana codebase, allowing Ethereum DApps to run on the Velas Blockchain â€” now Ethereum developers can run their apps faster thanks to the advancements made under this Velas blockchain improvement.
