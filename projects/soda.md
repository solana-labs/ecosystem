Soda is a lending protocol with credit rating system. Soda provides easy-to-use lending service and credit system, Sol ID. Sol ID analyses both retail users and protocols'/institutions' on-chain behaviours, and build a credit profile. With this credit system we can achieve on-chain refinement management and have a new mechanism for protocol-to-protocol/business cooperation.
