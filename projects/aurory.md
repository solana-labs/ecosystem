Aurory is a gaming platform based on the play-to-earn mechanism. We strongly believe that the path for the future of gaming flows from pay-to-play, free-to-play, and finally landing at playing-to-earn.

Aurory wants people and gamers from everywhere in the world to discover blockchain uses in a fun and educating way. To achieve that goal, Aurory is powered by Solana and uses Serum for our in-game marketplace.
