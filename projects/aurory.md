Aurory is a JRPG computer gaming platform based on the play to earn mechanism. We strongly believe that this is the path for the future of gaming, flowing from pay to play, free to play and finally landing where we are heading, playing to earn. Aurory uses play-to-earn mechanis allowing players to earn tokens and NFTs while playing the game. Aury, the in game currency, will allow you to buy items from other players in the marketplace, while also directly benefiting from the growth of Aurory.

Aurory wants people and gamers from everywhere in the world to discover blockchain use cases in a fun and educating way. To achieve that ambitious goal, Aurory chose to be powered by Solana and to use Serum for our in-game marketplace.
