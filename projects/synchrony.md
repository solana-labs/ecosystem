Synchrony is an on-chain automated portfolio and asset management protocol featuring copy-trading and indices as well as wallet and protocol analytics. Synchrony achieves true trustlessness through the use of highly configurable indices. Users are able compose and index dynamic sets of tokens, liquidity pools, and strategies to create algorithmically optimized and automatically rebalancing pools or portfolios.

Copy-trading leverages these indices, equiping users to define the parameters for which a copy-trade is considered a candidate for execution.

Synchrony’s analytics and aggregation services provides data for users to make informed decisions with respect to index and copy-trade parameters and to their own on-chain behaviour. To facilitate a smooth user experience, Synchrony’s front-end features a marketplace that, along with the aforementioned suite of tools, enables users to interact with the entire Solana ecosystem from one location.
