Off-piste is a decentralized platform allowing retail and institutional participants to gain exposure to pre-IPO markets through synthetic derivatives. These digital assets are financially settled at closing price on IPO day, enabling the protocol to be a price and demand discovery mechanism for private companies. This will help facilitate less volatile IPOs and democratize access to private capital markets for the global population. The protocol leverages Serum's on-chain order book based DEX to give users a familiar experience and to truly enable price and demand discovery.
