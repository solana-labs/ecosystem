SolStreet is a Solana-based, non-custodial asset management and investment protocol that aims to solve the problems inherent to traditional finance by allowing anyone to launch a decentralized fund directly to market, with negligible up-front or ongoing costs. All trades and assets remain verifiably secure, on-chain.

Anybody can directly launch, or invest into, a decentralized, non-custodial fund. All trades and assets remain verifiably on-chain via the use of the Serum DEX. The protocol facilitates subscriptions and redemptions to and from investment funds seamlessly and at near-zero cost.

The founding teamâ€™s expertise goes beyond just operating investment funds, and extends into making successful seed investments into groundbreaking disruptors in finance and tech.
