OpenOcean is the worldâ€™s first leading full aggregator which provides the entrance to crypto trading and pools liquidity from both the DeFi and CeFi. OpenOcean now offers crypto traders the best possible price with lowest slippage. Our protocol utilizes an optimized version of the Dijkstra algorithm called D-star, which splits routing between different protocols for better rates. OpenOcean then compares the best prices on DEXs and CEXs before empowering users to have their order executed at the best possible rate.

OpenOcean now supports cross-chain interaction between the BSC and Ethereum and other public chains via Binance Bridge, and will support direct cross-chain transactions in the future once the infrastructure is ready. We will also enable cross-chain transactions by aggregating the Dex of the Polkadot ecosystem. We enable withdrawal to any chain from your OpenOcean account to your wallet after your transaction on the aggregated CEX.
