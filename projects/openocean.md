OpenOcean is the world’s first leading full aggregator, providing an entrance to crypto trading and pools liquidity from both the DeFi and CeFi, and offering crypto traders the best possible price with lowest slippage. Our protocol implements an optimized version of the Dijkstra algorithm called D-star, which splits routing between different protocols for better rates. Following this, OpenOcean then compares the best prices on DEXs and CEXs, empowering users to have their order executed at the best possible rate.

OpenOcean supports cross-chain interaction between the BSC and Ethereum and other public chains via Binance Bridge, and will eventially support direct cross-chain transactions. By aggregating the DEX of the Polkadot system, we support cross-chain transactions. After completing the transaction, withdraw seamlessly to any wallet from any chain.
