Afflarium is a massively multiplayer online metaverse, playable on VR, Desktop, and Mobile.

Afflarium does not have a set story that the player must navigate through from start to finish. The
player is the director of their own adventure navigating the world of opportunities.
It’s a place with plenty of large worlds made to fit anyone’s taste and needs where each world is
unique and interconnected with one another. Afflarium is built with stunning graphics, made possible
with state-of-the-art technology that keeps improving.
In Afflarium you socialize, challenge yourself against other players and conduct various economic
activities. Afflarium is using a real economy powered by blockchain technology that brings a unique
gaming experience.

them away from other players, use them or trade with them.

blockchain technology.
