The Acumen protocol is an autonomous, non-custodial interest rate protocol native to the Solana blockchain that uses algorithmically set interest rates to enable open financial applications.

Acumen facilitates seamless interest-earning by establishing decentralized money markets, which are pools of assets with algorithmically set interest rates based on the supply and demand of loanable funds. Acumen engenders the ability to earn interest on your SPL tokens by connecting suppliers and borrowers of assets together. The Acumen protocol is inspired by Compound and Aave. Interest rate models and the architecture have been modeled off these protocols.
