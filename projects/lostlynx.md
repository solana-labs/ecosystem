LYNX LORE

There was once a society of 3,000 Lynxes who lived in peace and prosperity amongst each other with multiple tribes and clans on a world named Lynxenara. 
One day a Lynx of the mage clan practicing in the dark arts unintentionally caused a dimensional rift tear which resulted in the Lynxes being scattered across multiple dimensions and timelines. 
The only way to restore balance and order to the Lost Lynx Society is by collecting all 3,000 Lynxes and sending them back to their original world.
