SolLotto is the first decentralized peer-to-peer lottery system built on the Solana blockchain.

We believe a community-driven approach to effective altruism will result in the most impact globally, which is why we're introducing a lottery system that utilizes verifiable community-consensus to dynamically allocate the resources where the community believes they will do the most good each week.

Buy a ticket, vote on the charity, and hope your SolLotto ticket takes you to the moon!
