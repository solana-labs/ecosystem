Metaplex is a protocol built on top of Solana that allows: Creating and minting non-fungible tokens; starting a variety of auctions for primary/secondary sales, and Visualizing NFTs in a standard way across wallets and applications.

Metaplex is comprised of two core components: an on-chain program, and a self-hosted front-end web2 application. Metaplex lets artists and creators launch their own self-hosted NFT storefronts as easily as building a website.
