MEMO is a next-generation large-scale decentralized cloud storage system based on blockchain. It uses global edge storage nodes to provide users with safe, efficient and large-scale storage services.

MEMO is committed to solve the impractical problems of decentralized cloud storage system. Through using innovative data verification mechanisms and a number of unique and patent-protected data repair technologies, it greatly optimizes the current distributed storage system, i.e., makes data storage much safer, more reliable and available.

SOLAMEMO Bridge is a connection between Solana and Memoriae maintained by a group of transmitters. The bridge provides interfaces for the users in Solana blockchain to store their data in Memo, or retrieve their data from Memo easily and safely, without running Solana and Memo simultaneously and exchanging their tokens.
