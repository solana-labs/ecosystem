SoproX is a tool that helps developers to conveniently create a Solana Rust-based program (SRP) with no build configuration. To simplify Solanaâ€™s program development, the team created a solution for developers to immediately bootstrap their programs. There are several built-in templates with many levels of readability in SoproX, including a Hello World instance for new developers to learn Solana.
