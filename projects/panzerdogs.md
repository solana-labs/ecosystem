Panzerdogs is a Solana NFT gaming project where users can own each in-game asset and use them to battle against each other in tanks. Think Brawl Stars, but with tanks and play to earn mechanics.
Our focus is game first, then blockchain. By using blockchain technology, we believe players of Panzerdogs will have a new way of interactions with gaming. Together with the community we are building a game that is accessible for a wide audience and fun to play.
