What is a stargarden?

A floating island that is the point of entry to our metaverse. An NFT designed to be used in our upcoming p2e game.
By minting a Founding StarGarden, you become the owner of a unique non fungible token, a digital collectible, that will be usable in our upcoming game. The NFT will unlock access to a play space in the game and the owner will be leader of the Tribe that populates it. Your StarGarden in the game will level up along with its members and have play to earn capabilities.
