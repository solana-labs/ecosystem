Car Collective is the FIRST NFT project to produce pixelated automotive artwork at a large-scale, driving car culture into the NFT space.
There will be 2415 hand designed NFT collectibles, which will be created on the Solana Blockchain.
Each piece has been designed by our very own in-house artist, who has had a passion for designing cars since he could hold a pencil.
Every pixel and choice of colour shading has been
meticulously placed to characterise a refined, detailed and unique representation of the most iconic vehicles of our time and beyond.
