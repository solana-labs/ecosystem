Holdana is a community-driven token built on Solana Ecosystem. We plan to be the first hold-rewarding token, providing our already strong and fast-growing community a fun & rewarding experience.
Our philosophy is to reward and federate our community around the holders by distributing supply as well as exclusive NFTs through weekly airdrops to community members that meet the conditions.
We aim to build a strong bond with our community and holders, bringing new users into the Solana ecosystem.
