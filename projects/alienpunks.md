AlienPunks are a group of 5,555 algorythmically generated NFTs that live in the Solana network.

Each Alien is a one-of-one NFT that has been created from over 70 different variables, such as skin color, eyes, mouth, headwear, background, and other accessories.

These Aliens have been displaced from their planet, and have found Earth as their new home. Most of them are harmless beings that will use any objects & accessories to blend in, but some have malicious intent...
