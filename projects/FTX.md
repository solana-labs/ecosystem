FTX, Alameda Research, and a consortium of other partners created the Serum Foundation and announced Serum, a new high-speed, non-custodial DEX that’s built on Solana. You can learn more about Serum from their website.
Serum is a complete, non-custodial decentralized exchange running on an on-chain central limit order book (CLOB) on Solana’s mainnet. Yep, you read that right.
More specifically, Serum is the only high-performant DEX designed around a fully on-chain central limit order book and matching engine. Ecosystem partners can compose with Serum’s on-chain orderbook to share liquidity and power their trading features for institutional and retail users.
Serum aims to resolve the traditional problems of DeFi: high gas costs, slow transactions, centralization, low capital efficiency, and liquidity segmentation. Serum is permissionless and seeks to decentralize the entire DeFi stack. Nothing will be left centralized.
