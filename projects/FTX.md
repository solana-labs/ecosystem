FTX, Alameda Research, and a consortium of other partners created the Serum Foundation and announced Serum, a new high-speed, non-custodial DEX that’s built on Solana. Serum is a complete, non-custodial decentralized exchange running on an on-chain central limit order book (CLOB) on Solana’s mainnet. Yep, you read that right.
More specifically, Serum is the only high-performant DEX designed around a fully on-chain central limit order book and matching engine. Ecosystem partners can compose with Serum’s on-chain orderbook to share liquidity and power their trading features for institutional and retail users.
Serum aims to resolve the traditional problems of DeFi: high gas costs, slow transactions, centralization, low capital efficiency, and liquidity segmentation. Serum is permissionless and seeks to decentralize the entire DeFi stack. Nothing will be left centralized.
You can learn more about Serum on their website.
