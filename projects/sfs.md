Solana Fantasy Sports is an on-chain app where users can start a league by setting an entry amount in SOL. Friends pay an entry fee to join and choose players in the initial draft. Users can swap players during the game, and scores are published weekly by owner wallets fetched from an API. The highest scorer in each league gets to withdraw the entry amount collected.
