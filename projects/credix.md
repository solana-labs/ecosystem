Credix is the decentralised credit marketplace. Our protocol enables global access to efficient undercollateralized lending for non-bank loan originators (e.g. FinTech companies) in emerging markets and fixed-income investment opportunities for investors. Credix bridges traditional finance and DeFi with the regulatory compliant framework institutions need.
