Zeta Markets is a cutting-edge decentralized derivatives platform which facilitates liquid, non-custodial, and under-collateralized derivatives trading.
Zeta comprises an end-to-end decentralized exchange built for institutional grade derivatives liquidity, with sub-second order routing, matching, clearing, and settlement for a broad range of digital-assets.

Key advantages:
* Capital efficiency: under-collateralized margin system that allows leveraged trading and cross-margining.
* Sophisticated derivatives pricing: futures and options are priced fully on-chain using Black-Scholes-Merton models with accompanying interest rate and volatility surfaces.
* Unparalleled trading UX: derivatives trading can seem confusing, but it doesn't have to be. Zeta's UI/UX caters to both professional and casual traders - offering both a powerful yet intuitive experience.
* Closest experience to a CEX: using Serum under the hood for the on-chain orderbook matching engine and with sub-second pricing updates from Pyth, Zeta looks and feels like a CEX whilst remaining decentralized, permissionless and non-custodial.
