Zeta is building an options trading platform on Solana, enabling users to effectively hedge risk against crypto market movement and events.

Their value proposition:

- Hybrid orderbook and options AMM model (automated market maker) that allows for efficient pricing and deep liquidity
- Greater capital efficiency via under-collateralization
- Lightning fast transactions and low fees (thanks to Solana)
- A strong focus on the user experience with easy-to-trade derivative products and exciting underlyings
