Zelcore is a multi-asset, non-custodial platform available on both desktop and mobile.

Integration of the Solana ecosystem occurs on multiple levels. As a wallet, users store and manage SOL, with the ability to import any custom SPL token. Zelcore supports Solana's native wrapping options and can interact with any dApp via a built-in Solana Wallet adapter on link.zelcore.io. Moreover, Zelcore recently added a full fledged Serum DEX directly into the desktop and mobile platform.
