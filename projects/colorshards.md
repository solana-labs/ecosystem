Color Shards is a limited collection of 1000 digital artworks with proof of ownership stored on the Solana Blockchain.  Each artwork is one of a kind and is algorithmically generated from a single hexadecimal triplet.  The autonomous system generates random geometries and independently selects complementary colors from the original triplet.
