Soltomm is a protocol that will allow NFT holders to stake their NFTs and earn rewards for that.
It will also support the use of NFTs as collateral assets for borrowing fungible tokens.
One of the features of this platform is the flexibility of Lending/Staking NFTS for rewards and listing on our Marketplace simultaneously.
