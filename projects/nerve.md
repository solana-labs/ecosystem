Nerve is an automated market-maker (AMM) on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) designed for low-slippage trading of stablecoins and other pegged assets. Nerve's first pool was launched with a basket of dollar-pegged stablecoins consisting of BUSD, USDT, and USDC. The protocol has since launched pegged BTC and ETH pools, in service of its cross-chain Nerve Bridge, with more pools in development.

Nerve's offering on the Solana network is currently in development.
