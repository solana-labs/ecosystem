Raydium is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) and liquidity provider built on the Solana blockchain for the Serum Decentralized Exchange (DEX). Raydium has first-mover advantage as an AMM within Serum and it will be an integral part of bringing new and existing projects and protocols into the ecosystem. The protocol will be a bridge for projects looking to expand to Solana and Serum, and in the process Raydium and the RAY token will become a foundation for enabling further development with partners, its own platform, and the ecosystem as a whole.

Unlike any other AMMs, Raydium provides on-chain liquidity to a central limit order book, meaning that Raydium LPs get access to the entire order flow and liquidity of Serum.

In the long term, Raydium aims to emerge as a leading protocol among AMMs and liquidity providers on Serum, while leveraging the power of Solana to drive the evolution of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).
