Stardust helps indie game developers, regardless of their blockchain knowledge, create novel blockchain assets, and use them in their games. Using our API, with less than 10 lines of code, a game developer can instantly give players digital assets, marketplaces, payment methods, explorers and more.

Today, over ten games are actively being built with Stardust, and practically none of them are crypto-native. These games are being built instead by passionate game developers that want to unlock the power of virtual assets in gaming experiences. Our largest game is averaging between 50,000â€“70,000 monthly active users and had over 750,000 players in the last 12 months.
