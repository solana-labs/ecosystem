PARSIQ is a blockchain monitoring and automation work platform that acts as a multi-layer bridge between blockchain and off-chain applications. We automate the blockchain analysis and monitoring process, and provide a customizable workflow with real-time intelligence.

PARSIQ announced their integration with the Solana blockchain on February 26th, 2021, enabling users on the Solana network to reap the benefits of the PARSIQ ecosystem. Our push-based data-stream aggregator adds programmability on top of real time data-streams. Users can combine independent data streams and write arbitrary scenarios in reactive style using our easy scripting language.
