Entropy is a leading decentralized exchange built by developers on a mission to build open, secure, and powerful financial products. Entropy runs on audited smart contracts on Solana, which eliminates the need to trust a central exchange while trading. We combine the security and transparency of a decentralized exchange, with the speed and usability ofa centralized exchange.

Entropy is a leading decentralized exchange offering Perpetual, Margin, & Spot trading, as well as borrow / lend pools on Solana. Users can earn interest or take loans for a nominal fee as well as trade on margin with custom leverage.
