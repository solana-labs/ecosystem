Synergy Land is a blockchain multiplayer ARPG game currently in development by Sygergy Studio set in a fantasy world divided into four ecosystems, each based on the following elements: earth, water, fire and cold.

We hope to contribute to the inception of blockchain gaming, and, for this reason, we are working hard to build a strong community to develop a community-centric game.
