Jet Protocol is a borrowing and lending protocol built on the Solana blockchain.

Most of the widely used DeFi protocols used up until this point have been built on top of and supported by the Ethereum ecosystem. Jet is ready to take borrowing and lending to the next level using Solanaâ€™s bleeding edge tech, low transaction costs, speed, and scalability. Users can also look forward to Jet's innovative interest bearing products which will be used to create markets on Serum DEX.
