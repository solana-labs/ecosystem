Apricot is a lending protocol that provides borrowers with lowest collateral requirement, assisted self-liquidation, and minimal liquidation penalties. Along with a 2-hour liquidation guarantee mechanism, Apricot safeguards the interest of all stakeholders. To help users efficiently use their borrowed funds, Apricot also provides a suite of ancillary services. Currently margin trading with up to 9x leverage is supported, and more features are in the pipeline.
With Apricot, users can:

- Deposit assets to earn interests (Apricot Lend)
- Borrow assets for trading or leveraged yield farming (Apricot Cross-Farm)
- Pre-configure when and how automated deleveraging takes place (Apricot Assist)
