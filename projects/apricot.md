Apricot is a next-gen lending protocol that supports cross-margin leveraged yield farming. Our mission is to help users maximize yield while protecting their downsides.

With Apricot, users can 1) deposit assets to earn interests 2) borrow assets for trading or for cross-margin leveraged yield farming 3) pre-configure when and how automated deleveraging takes place.
