Waves is a Crypto-platform for asset/custom token issuance, transfer, and trading on the Waves blockchain, with centralized order matching and decentralized settlement.

We are thrilled to announce the integration of the Solana protocol into Gravity, a decentralized cross-chain and oracle network based on the Waves protocol. As a result of the integration, the Solana network will be available for data transfers between Gravity network participants.

“Thanks to the Solana integration, Gravity becomes a more enriched infrastructure that enables developers to create universally connected dApps, with more opportunities for practical implementation and mass adoption of DeFi,” says Alexey Pupyshev, Waves evangelist and co-creator of Gravity protocol.
