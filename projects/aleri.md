Aleri enables you to view NFT art on your smart TV. Aleri aims to be both a viewer and a collater of marketplaces, making it really easy for a consumer to browse, acquire and consume NFT art.

Solana will form the backbone of numerous Metaplex powered NFT platforms for bricks and mortar galleries and their artists, whilst also providing a means for self published artists to easily get onto the Aleri platform.
