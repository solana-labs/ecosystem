Mercurial is building the infrastructure for stable and pegged assets on Solana.

Mercurial's vaults are market-making and provide low slippage swaps for stables, while also improving LP profits with dynamic fees and flexible capital allocation.

Our focus will be on stable coins as they represent a large facet of DeFi demand across synthetic asset creation, swapping, and lending. Robust availability of stable coin liquidity is crucial to any DeFi ecosystem.
The DeFi ecosystem on Solana is evolving at an extremely fast pace, with stable coins of primary importance. We believe that a dynamic system such as Mercurial will provide a robust platform for users to obtain liquidity for moving towards the most productive channels.
