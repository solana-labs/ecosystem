Mercurial is building the infrastructure for stable and pegged assets for Solana.

Mercurial vaults are market making vaults providing low slippage swaps for stables, while also improving LP profits with dynamic fees and flexible capital allocation.

Our focus will be on stable coins because they represent a major part of the DeFi demand across synthetic assets creation, swapping, and lending. Robust availability of stablecoin liquidity is crucial to any DeFi ecosystem.
The DeFi ecosystem on Solana is evolving at an extremely fast pace, with stablecoins of primary importance. We believe that a dynamic system such as Mercurial will be able to provide a robust platform for users to easily get liquidity for channeling towards the most productive channels.
