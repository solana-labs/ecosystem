Switchboard is a generalized, community curated oracle network designed
to incentivize bringing the long tail of data on-chain. Harnessing the
wisdom of crowds, Switchboard creates a market of curators incentivized
to organize unique off-chain data sources and publishers to decentralize
quantitative data feeds.
