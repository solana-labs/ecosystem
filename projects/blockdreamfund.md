Block Dream Fund was established by the exchange OKEx in February 2021. OKEx has allocated $100 million to the Block Dream Fund in a bid to back talented entrepreneurs and exceptional projects innovating with blockchain technology.

Block Dream Fund will help early stage startups in the Solana ecosystem to identify growth opportunities in new markets, and expand business operations to the Asia-Pacific region. As a global brand, Block Dream Fundâ€™s media network will help startups discover new customers across the world.
In the last month alone, over 50 market-ready projects launched on Solana, including industry-leading DeFi applications, markets for NFTs, and infrastructure to support the next generation of Web 3 companies. Recent initiatives such as the Solana x Serum DeFi Hackathon saw 100+ project submissions from 3,000 builders. Raydium, an automated market maker (AMM) and liquidity provider built on the Solana blockchain for the Serum decentralized exchange (DEX), surpassed $160m total value locked, increasing more than 3000% in less than two months. With the rapid growth of the Solana ecosystem, the Block Dream Fund looks forward to providing continued support to companies building on Solana.
