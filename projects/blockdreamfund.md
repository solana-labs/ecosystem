Block Dream Fund was established by the exchange OKEx in February 2021. OKEx has allocated $100 million to the Block Dream Fund in a bid to empower talented entrepreneurs and exceptional projects innovating with blockchain technology.

Block Dream Fund is an investment institution under OKEx, focusing on exploring the best blockchain projects across the globe. It supports the most innovative early-stage blockchain projects.

Block Dream Fund will help early stage startups in Solana ecosystem to identify growth opportunities in new markets, and expand business operations to the asia-pacific region. As a global brand, Block Dream Fund’s media network will help startups discover new customers across the world.
In the last month alone, over 50 market-ready projects launched on Solana. These included industry-leading DeFi applications, markets for NFTs, and infrastructure to support the next generation of Web 3 companies. Recent initiatives such as the Solana x Serum DeFi Hackathon saw 100+ project submissions from 3,000 builders, just as Raydium, an automated market maker (AMM) and liquidity provider built on the Solana blockchain for the Serum decentralized exchange (DEX), surpassed $160m total value locked, increasing more than 3000% in less than two months. With the rapid growth of the Solana ecosystem, the Block Dream Fund looks forward to providing continued support to companies building on Solana.
