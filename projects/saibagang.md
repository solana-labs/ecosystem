It is the year 2167 in Wintermoon City, and technology has advanced to the point where human cybernetic enhancement is commonplace in the underground community.

The nefarious technocrats that control Wintermoon City, the Kaze Collective, make life on the streets a brutal existence. Teens are force to fight and steal to survive.

Alone they struggle to get by, but together... they just might make it. That is why these cybernetically enhanced street punks came together to form the Saiba Gang.

These eccentric rebels are bound to have some adventures. They might even be the only force that can topple the system and overthrow the Kaze Collective.
