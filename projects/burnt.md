Burnt Finance is a Solana-based non-fungible token (NFT) minting and auction protocol. Burnt provides an intuitive interface for minting new assets, such as synthetics, NFTs, and new digital assets. In less than a few minutes, a user can mint a new asset and setup an entirely decentralized auction.
