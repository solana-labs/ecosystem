Hollow Soldiers are two groups of 3333 NFTs that are algorithmically generated, undead, and violent soldiers battling (see Battleground) for the reigns of a post-apocalyptic Earth housed on the Solana Blockchain.

Each soldier is part of a faction, The Ravagers and The Roamers. Each one is unique and randomly generated with more than 99 traits. The traits will play a part in Generation 2 and an in-browser game which will begin development after launch.
