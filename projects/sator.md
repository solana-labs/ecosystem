SAO is the social utility token that fuels the Sator network. SAO gets distributed to viewers and content creators depending on their engagement with the system. At a high level, 
television creators and distributors need SAO to have their product (e.g. network series) activated on the Sator platform and are rewarded by gaining engagement and growth of their viewership.
At the same time, viewers that hold SAO are rewarded for interacting with the series content. In essence, this democratizes the typical television paradigm in which viewers generate the value of a show.
