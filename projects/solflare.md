SolFlare supports sending and receiving native SOL tokens as well as sending and receiving SPL Tokens
(Solana's ERC-20 equivalent). SolFlare also supports staking of SOL tokens.

As a non-custodial wallet, your private keys are not stored by the SolFlare site itself, but rather they are stored in an encrypted Keystore File or on a Ledger Nano S or X hardware wallet.
