Solana Space Telescope is based on a generative machine learning algorithm and some secret ingredients, thanks to this all the generated NFTs are unique. In the interest of fairness and to give everyone the chance to own one (or more) Solana space photos, the purchase is made on a random basis. The NFT will remain a mystery until your purchase is completed. No first come, first serve. The NFTs obtained are visible on your wallet and will be exchangeable on others marketplaces. It is a telescope in an unexplored space, need to add more?
