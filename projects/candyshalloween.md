Candy is the hero of our story. The name comes from Metaplex’s Candy Machine. We salute Metaplex respectfully as we found inspiration in it.

Our story tells about Candy’s Halloween Night. She will visit 8888 different Halloween Houses and distribute gifts through games.

Will it be a game like “Trick or Treat” ? Well, ...no idea. We just want it to be a little mysterious. Come buy a house and be part of the story, now is the time.

Next stage is nft staking, create unique nft game and governance ecosystem.
