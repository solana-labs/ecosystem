InfinityDrakes are a one-of-a-kind collection of unique InfinityEggs that can be evolved to KingDrakes. We have over 200 different Attributes, every Drake is rendered uniquely in 3D and flying on the SolanaVerse!
On Mint Day you may be able to secure yourself your InfinityEggs. Each Egg will hatch after a short time to become a BabyDrake. Afterwards you are able to fuse 2 BabyDrakes together to get a new TeenageDrake! If you are fully immersed in the Kingdom you'll be fusing together 2 TeenageDrakes to get the final KingDrake. Be careful, the FinalDrake is the rarest Drake out here and there are only 2,500 available as only the best can breed them!
Once a month a Tribeevent will be held! According to their tribe and evolution, the Drakes have different abilities. You will be able to fight with your Drake(s) against a common enemy and get rewards if you win the battle!
Starting January 5th!
