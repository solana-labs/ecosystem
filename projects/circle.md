$USDC is now integrated natively on Solana!

Crypto traders and developers can now use USDC--one of the most popular stablecoins--on fast, scalable, and cost-effective rails provided by the Solana blockchain.

Ecosystem projects like FTX and Serum have already added Solana USDC into their products, and Circle is planning to launch USDC-SPL across their entire suite of platform services.
