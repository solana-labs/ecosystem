Up to $20M will be deployed to teams and projects building on Solana via HashKey's Solana-specific ecosystem fund. Hashkey Capital employs a rigorous screening process based on their deep knowledge of blockchain and digital asset markets, thematic research, and extensive industry tracking.

Since November 2018, Hashkey has used this approach to evaluate over 1,000 opportunities, and have invested in more than 75 projects.

As a key member of the APAC blockchain community, the HashKey Capital ecosystem fund is uniquely positioned to support the growth of Solana ecosystem projects in the region.
