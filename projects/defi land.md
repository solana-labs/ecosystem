DeFi Land is a multi-chain game aiming for the best user experience and on-boarding process. But we had to start somewhere. That’s why we were observing closely to determine which blockchain to begin with. We wanted transaction fees to be low and speed to be fast while maintaining security. DeFi Land chose to build on Solana as it offers everything that players need - one of the fastest transaction processing speeds alongside near zero fees. In addition, Solana’s ecosystem is rapidly growing as it attracts the biggest talents to build game-changing projects. We strongly believe that it’s crucial to be fast, cheap and secure to create the smoothest DeFi experience via gamification.
