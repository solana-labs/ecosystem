Solanaliens is an NFT project on the Solana blockchain.

Solanaliens NFTs are collections of programmatically, randomly generated NFTs on the Solana blockchain.

Solanaliens can be found with a variety of different colours, outfits, and faces but no two Solanaliens are alike.

Each Solanalien brings their own style with unique hats, hair, clothing, and faces from a total of 286 different attributes.

Solanaliens are scored on a scale of 4 to 16 points. The ranking and background color of your Solanaliens is determined by the total score of all attribute scores. Rarer items or features like an astronaut suit will score higher than common items like a t-shirt.
