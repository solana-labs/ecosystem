Katana offers a suite of investment products across the risk spectrum,
enabling users to passively access the best yield-generating opportunities on Solana.
Katana's goal is to offer sophisticated, sustainable, and composable yield products which users can mix and match to produce their desired exposure.

To this end, our core product suite is comprised of automated vault strategies and structured products--similar to
Yearn and Ribbon Finance on Ethereum--and we look to expand into more exotic product lines in the near future.
