Meet the validators who power Solana, the world's fastest blockchain! If you own SOL tokens, and seek a staking partner, you can use Validators.app to create a "short-list" of validators.

Once you have a short-list, reach out to them and start a conversation! Ask questions about data center location, computer security, redundancy, etc. before making a final decision. Try to delegate SOL to several different validators to make the network stronger.
