Lumos Exchange is currently the only P2P exchange with a focus on Solana. Our solution integrates with SOL by providing buy/sell features in 186 countries and utilising more than 100+ payment methods.

Every project that currently exists on Solana could be accessible by purchasing SOL via Lumos Exchange.
