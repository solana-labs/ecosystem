Structured products in traditional finance are simply a combination of two or more financial instruments that comprise a single product that pays out based on the performance of the underlying assets. The Structured Products team built a system which allows users to match and lock single deposits with the shared goal of executing a particular trading strategy, coupled with position management bots that read and respond to Serum DEXâ€™s market data.
