Street Dreams is a collective of creators rooted in photography who have invested heavily in the art of photography. The founders have taken their love of photography and turned it into a calling for their peers, as well as an rapidly expanding publishing and multimedia brand. Street Dreams has also attracted the attention of a multitude of brands, cultural institutions and large corporations. Street Dreams Magazine has independently produced and published 13,000 print copies across 15 editions since the projectâ€™s inception.
