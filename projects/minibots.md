MiniBots are 5,999 unique, high tech, collectible high definition art. Each MiniBot was algorithmically generated on their home planet, 
Planet Cooper. Each MiniBot has proof of ownership all stored on the Solana Blockchain.

Each MiniBot was created on their home planet, Planet Cooper, with uniqueness in mind. 
Every MiniBot is special in its own way, and is created from 6 different types of traits like faces, headgear, drills, 
and much more with over 150 unique attributes! Some traits are more rare than others, ranging from Common to Mythic!
All of this variation leads to extremely rare MiniBots! Over the course of the next few weeks we will be releasing more and more sneak peaks of MiniBot traits!
