Oxygen is a DeFi prime brokerage service built on Solana and powered by Serum's on-chain infrastructure. Oxygen is built around Pools, or baskets of assets that take collective actions. Starting with a borrow-lending facility, users will be able to earn yield and get leverage against their portfolios, setting the foundation for a vibrant and decentralized financial ecosystem.

It allows for a more efficient use of your assets in three key ways:

1. Multiple use of the same collateral- Oxygen enables you to generate yield on your portfolio through lending out your assets  
   and borrowing other assets at the same time.
2. Cross-collateralization - With Oxygen, you can utilize your portfolio as collateral, when you want to borrow other
   assets. This should mean lower margin call/liquidation risk for your portfolio.
3. Market-based pricing - Oxygen protocol is order-book based, rather than following a pre-set market model that needs to be
   manually adjusted. This means you get the best/fair price for borrowing/lending every time.
