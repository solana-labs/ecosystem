Each fund is composed of Muon developed indexes that can track a wide range of investment strategies and each fund is modular, meaning they can be a component of another fund (fund of funds), which we affectionately call DeFi lego. By leveraging the Solana & Serum ecosystems, Muon delivers a fast, streamlined and cost-efficient platform for on-chain asset management.
