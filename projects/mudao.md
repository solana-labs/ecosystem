Each fund is composed of Muon developed indexes that can track a wide range of investment strategies. Each fund is modular, meaning they can be a component of another fund (fund of funds), which we have termed "DeFi Lego." By leveraging the Solana & Serum ecosystems, Muon delivers a fast, streamlined, and cost-efficient platform for on-chain asset management.
