Designed by a leading Korean K-pop artist agency, HUMAP, with input from famous K-pop stars, 
Yuna will release her own album and host virtual concerts across the world. Just like BTS and BlackPink, Yuna is going to take the world by storm.

The first phase: 10,000 limited edition and unique NFT illustrations of Yuna by Korea’s leading artist, SONGBLY84
Fans will own a one-of-a-kind scarce digital asset which will yield royalties from Yuna’s future albums, concerts, and sponsorships, 
and exclusive access to private performances. Lucky fans will be able to provide input into the lyrics of Yuna’s songs and participate in vocal training 
from a famous K-pop song producer.
