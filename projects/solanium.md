The Solanium platform is a decentralized platform on the Solana blockchain. The platform will introduce decentralized fundraising, time-weighted token staking, and governance voting to the Solana ecosystem. Solanium users will be able to create and participate in pools ("token sales") with only SPL tokens. Users will also be able to stake our own SPL token ("SLIM").
