ROPE is the central token of the ROPE ecosystem. The ROPE token holds the following utility:

1. Holders will be able to stake ROPE tokens to generate additional yield earned from trading fees.
2. The potential to stake ROPE for additional multipliers on yield.
3. The potential for stakers of ROPE to participate and vote on community proposals and amendments.

The ROPE ecosystem is comprised of two tokens, ROPE and ROPEV, and is built on top of the high-performance Proof of History (PoH) technology implemented by the Solana network.

ROPEV is a DeFi-based volatility index for the De-Fi ecosystem. This instrument will allow users to trade or hedge with a volatility index within the entire cryptocurrency market. The details on technical implementation will be published according to the roadmap. Users will be able to trade ROPEV using the ROPEx trading platform.
