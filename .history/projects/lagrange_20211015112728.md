Lagrange tries to solve many of the problems of the real world by leveraging Solana’s existing technology. We are building an interface to a decentralized liquidity network similar to FOREX Electronic Communication Network. We are doing this by connecting to liquidity providers on different blockchains. Further, the connection between the Real World Hierarchy and Crypto World Hierarchy will be established with the help of CEX and Stablecoin companies. We are also building a DEX and different tools for creating markets dedicated specifically to Digital Currencies and Forex.
