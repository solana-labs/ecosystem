# Solana Ecosystem

This repository is the data source for the Solana Ecosystem page,
located at [solana.com/ecosystem](https://solana.com/ecosystem).

# Contributing Guidelines

A project is composed of two files: a Markdown file with headers, and an
image. To add a new project to the ecosystem page, create both a new Markdown
file in the `projects` directory and add a new image in the `img` directory.

**!Important!**:
Should your Project already exist within this repo, refrain from creating a new
Markdown file in the `projects` directory! Rather adapt your old one in a new PR.
Same goes for changed images or Logos for your Project.

### Example File
