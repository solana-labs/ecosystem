Maps.me is the world’s leading offline mapping service. In nine years, it has grown to 140 million users, with 60 million people using it to navigate 195 countries in 2020. Pilots, magazine photographers, professional cyclists, aid workers, and everyday travellers love using its turn-by-turn routing, travel guides, and detailed mapping – all available without using often costly mobile data.

With Maps.me 2.0, Maps is beginning to embed DeFi services into an app that already has a special relationship with millions of users. The wallet will be an intuitive part of an already familiar platform, meaning there is no learning curve.
