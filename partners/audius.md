Audius is the latest project to move over to Solana and has been growing rapidly, now with over 1 million monthly listeners. However, as their active users have increased, so have the gas fees and load times. Solana was selected after the Audius team reviewed and tested over 20 layer 1 and layer 2 scaling solutions. Through that vetting process, it was clear that Solana was the only system that could deliver the speed, low fees, and censorship resistance necessary to grow Audius to a mainstream, global audience.

The Solana Foundation is looking forward to working with the world-class Audius team on the content ledger integration and will share updates soon. Also, if you haven’t done so already, sign up for an Audius account and join the decentralized music streaming community!
